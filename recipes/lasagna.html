            The origins of lasagna can be traced back to ancient Greece, where flat pasta sheets were layered with cheese and baked. 
            The dish was later adopted by the Romans, who added meat and tomato sauce to the recipe. 
            Today, lasagna is enjoyed all over the world and is a staple of Italian cuisine.
